Main objective is to improve parity of the ZLM library with the GLM inspiration. This largely consists of implementing and testing specific linear algebra methods that are currently missing from ZLM.

- [ ] Add `rotate(Mat4, f32, vec3): Mat4` method, including basic tests

- [ ] Add `scale(Mat4, vec3): Mat4` method, including basic tests

- [ ] Add `translate(Mat4, vec3): Mat4` method, including basic tests

- [ ] Add `radians(f32)` and `degrees(f32)` methods, including basic tests

- [ ] Add `value_ptr(Mat4): *f32` (or Zig-like equivalent) method, including basic tests
